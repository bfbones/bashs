Some Bash-Scripts.. just for..

profile: MotD for Linux Server.. used for /etc/profile

manage.sh: Script for managing a some more Servers and don't want puppet. Stuff like pingcheck, spread files, do commands, make updates. And extra tools like DNS Check for Domains.


All scripts are written mostly in hurry and for me. So they can be dirty.
