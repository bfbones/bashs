Some Bash-Scripts.. just for..

profile: MotD for Linux Server.. used for /etc/profile

manage.sh: Script for managing a some more Servers and don't want puppet. Stuff like pingcheck, spread files, do commands, make updates. And extra tools like DNS Check for Domains. Put to /usr/local/bin.

.manage_kupdatehelper.sh: Helper for manage.sh. Put to /usr/local/bin.


**All scripts are written mostly in hurry and for me. So they can be dirty.**
